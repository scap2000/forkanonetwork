<h1 align="center">This is the main github repository for the Forkano Network</h1>

## What is Forkano, or Forkano Network?
* Forkano is "just" a Fork of Cardano, it means, a "from scratch" started blockchain network, with its own policies and purposes, which are described below. Forkano borns from the original <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk" target="blank">Cardano source code available on github</a>, accessible to anyone thanks to the IOHK adopting the Open Source phylosophy. The mobile wallet is a fork from <a href="https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-mobile" target="blank">Yoroi Wallet</a>, called Forkano Vault, modified and adapted to the Forkano network.</h3>

## What can you do with Forkano? 
* Learn how to create and run your own validator node(s)
* Earn rewards in the native Forkano asset (CAP)
* Learn how to create and run a validator node and then convert it onto a stake pool
* Learn how to delegate an receive delegations
* Create, mint and transfer assets (tokens)
* Create, mint and transfer NFT's

## Why does Forkano Network exists?
* Because I believe that people need to learn, train and made mistakes in an alternative network, avoiding costs

## What is Forkano's main native asset?
* It's called CAP © and it's represented by a bottle cap like the Nuka-Cola caps from Fallout Games
* Fallout? Why?
    *   Because in the main story of this game, the world economy has collapsed and one form of value are the Nuka-Cola bottle caps
    * ⚡ Fun fact: Yes, I'm fan of Fallout

## Contributing
As this is a non-profit project, which demands a lot of time, effort and paid services, Forkano will survive by:
  * Having people using the network and creating stake pools
  * Getting some advanced devs creating
  * Your special donations

## Donation addresses (crypto only)
* **ADA Address over Cardano Network**: addr1qxtdszvk7y5py6yu6yka27fsxpej5c33cu570fk6zg7tshwpkr4eltx90uad3gx4pr6s747vc94g26954lpk06swhcnsdqv0c9

* **USDT Address TRC-20 network**: TXPNLaLYNGd5TFkkDif9BY8PcMUeChqrY2

## Purposes
 * Education and training
   - Anyone will have the possibility to access the network and operate with no restrictions
        + Creating and transfer assets (native tokens)
        + Creating and transfer NFTs, aka "Non Forkable Tokens" ;)
        + Creating and operate staking pools
 * Accessibility
    - Anyone will have access to an airdrop of a certain amount of CAP in order to have the ability to use the network without buying nor spending money
        + Why? Because I believe in some places it is not "that" easy to buy native tokens from another blockchains, like ADA or ETH, where people must spend money to use those networks
 * Easiness of adoption
   - By giving easiness of access to enough people, this will lead to more adoption
   - More adoption means more users willing to participate
   - More users means, maybe, more staking pools and nodes
   - More nodes means more decentralization
   - Decentralization is the main goal
   - Once people sees the power of decentralization, ANY blockchain could be evaluated as is for it's "grade of decentralization"
   - Remember: internet is disruptive because of decentralization. Bitcoin is disruptive because of decentralization.
   - Decentralization: NO MAIN CONTROL, NO SIGLE POINT OF FAILURE, NO UNILATERAL DECISIONS -> Consensus (read about Ouroboros)
 * Support and help
   - This project was born as a "solo" project. But with your participation, a lot of people could participate and help each other.
     + Helping each other means: collaboration
     + Collaboration leads to community
     + A large community will lead to resilience and a stronger project
     + This is just a project, but with your help, this could be a fully educational and supporting network
       + Why? That's not the question, but "how?" -> With your participation
 * Promote adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology

## Policies and Tokenomics
* This policies describes the Forkano Network "initial laws" and the "behavior".
    * The main token of the Forkano Network will be named as CAP or ©
        * The name CAP © is a tribute to Fallout game.
        * In Fallout, the currency are the Nuka Cola bottle caps - See: Fallout WIKI
    * Limited supply of © 10,000,000,000 CAP
    * Initial supply of © ~168,000,000 CAP
 * © 100,000,000 million, from the initial supply, will be treated as whale wallets, for delegating to the first 100 staking pools created
   - Every new staking pool, will have delegated from this whale wallets, © 1,000,000 CAP each, to ensure equity and fair competition between pools
   - After certain time, to be determined (could be 150 epoch, which are 150 days ~5 months), the pool will have enough rewards, the © 1,000,000 delegated will be retired and destined to another new pool, again, to ensure equity and fair competition
